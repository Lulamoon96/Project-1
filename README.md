USER JOURNEY
 
AS A user with access to cooking materials and local grocery

I WANT to search for a recipe to create a meal and find a store carrying the necessary items

SO THAT I can cook a nice meal

BUSINESS CONTEXT

For many adults, trying to figure out what to cook and where to get all the supplies takes too much time, planning, and research that it becomes inefficient to execute. With the adoption of this meal planner, one can quickly locate a recipe for a meal they currently desire, and instantly view the local stores that carry the needed items for the recipe. This will allow the user to have more time to focus on the other aspects of their busy day.
